run_analysis.R

Dataset:

The following dataset represents data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Project Requirements:  Create file run_analysis.R to do the following:

1.  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set;

2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; 

3.  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;

4.  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.  From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

6.  Create a codebook describing all variables.

How to run the script:

1.  Download dataset linked above into same working directory as run_analysis.R.

2.  Source and run file run_analysis.R

3.  After code is run, file tidy.txt will be located in the same working directory.

4.  See code_book.md in this repository for description of all variables.
